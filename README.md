# gaucheyjava

huh, you're here

No, I didn't make this for my CV or portfolio or whatever. I'm simply killing time whenever I'm bored.
Uhhh what else should I write here? Ah yes, you might been wondering why its written in java? 
Well, why not? Give me a break, I'll code in python soon enough. 
Nevermind, I've figured. I'm currently code in linux (PopOs), I can easily compile with java without
rewrite the source code again.

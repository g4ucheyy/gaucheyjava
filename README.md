# GameSuite

huh, you're here

No, I didn't make this for my CV or portfolio or whatever. I'm simply killing time when I'm bored 
(and curious).
Uhhh what else should I write here? Ah yes, you might been wondering why its written in java? 
Well, why not? Give me a break, I'll code in python soon enough. (probably never)
Nevermind, I've figured. I'm currently code in linux (PopOs), I can easily compile with java without
rewrite the source code again.
Well the v1.0 is here! I'm looking forward for improvements and updates. The v1.0
consisting of basic number guessing game, rock paper scissors and coin flip.
More features are coming soon!
